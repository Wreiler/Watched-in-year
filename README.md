Analysis of watched films during a year with Jupiter Notebook


I created a notebook to keep a list of watched movies

There are 8 sections for analyzing watched movies and series

  #### 1) Pivot tables
      - tables for movies and series
      - you can choose the output order (by date or alphabetically), 
      as well as the number of output lines (last 10 or all)
  #### 2) Adding the last watched movie or series
      - you need to enter the name of the movie or series (the word "season" must be mentioned)
      - as well as the date of viewing (end of viewing for the series) in the format DD.MM
  #### 3) Counting the number of films and the distance to the target
      - displays the number of films watched and the remaining number to the intended goal
  #### 4) Counting the number of series
      - displays the number of TV series watched
  #### 5) Last watched movie
      - displays the last watched movie and the date of its viewing
  #### 6) Last watched series (season of the series)
      - displays the last watched series and the end date of its viewing
  #### 7) Display movie list (in alphabetical order)
      - displays a list of all watched movies at the moment in alphabetical order
  #### 8) Displaying a list of series (in alphabetical order) and counting seasons
      - displays a list of all watched TV shows and the total number of seasons
